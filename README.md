# GadgetConverter

A program to convert old binary Gadget type 2 snapshots to more useful Gadget
HDF5 snapshots following the same conventions as e.g. Shadowfax.

To compile, run cmake in a preferably empty new folder and then run make.
There is only one dependency (apart from CMake and a C++ compiler): HDF5.
